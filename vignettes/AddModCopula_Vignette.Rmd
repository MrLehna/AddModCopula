Within this vignette, all functions of the AddModCopula package are explained in
detail, with the following structure.

1. Within the first section, the structure of the input factors is discussed. This includes the choices of distributions. 
2. In the second section, the global_creg function is used to calculate the likelihood of a given set of parameters for a copula. 
3. In the third section, the previous results are now used in the creg_opt function to optimize the parameter selection of the additive model. 
4. In the last section, additional extension of the function are presented. 

```{r setup}
library(AddModCopula)
